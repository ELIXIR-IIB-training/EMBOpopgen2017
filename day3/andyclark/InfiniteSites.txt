# Given count of SNPs, estimate theta (Watterson)

# ASSIGNMENT 1: Suppose you observe 52 SNPs in a sample of 100 individuals.  Use the 
# Infinite Sites model to estimate theta (this is known as the Watterson estimator of theta).
# What if there were 26 SNPs instead of 52?   What if the sample size was 50 instead of 100?

# ASSIGNMENT 2: See if you can show that the expected number of singletons depends only 
# on theta and (amazingly) NOT on the sample size.
