# ASSIGNMENT 1: Conduct runs of the above simulation, and calculate the variance
# in allele frequencies across 20 independent sample populations for each of
# generations 20 through 200 in steps of 20.  Plot the results.
# Hint: the variance of allele freq at gen i is var(pcur[i,])

# ASSIGNMENT 2: Plot the expected time to fixation (when allele frequency is
# either zero or one) for 20 populations with population sizes 50, 100, 150 and 200.
