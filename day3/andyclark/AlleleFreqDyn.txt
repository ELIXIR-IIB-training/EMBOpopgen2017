# ASSIGNMENT 1: For each of the sample data sets, try to devise a way to estimate the population
# size N from the rate of increase in variance in allele frequencies over generations.
# In the data sets, columns are distinct SNPs and rows are generations.


# ASSIGNMENT 2: It turns out that the sample data sets each has one SNP that deviates from the
# neutral dynamics. Use whatever test you can devise to determine which of the SNPs in the sample
# data sets appear to depart from neutrality,
