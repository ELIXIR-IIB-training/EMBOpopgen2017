#Asymptotic McDonald–Kreitman Test to estimate the proportion of non-synonymous substitutions driven by positive selection.s

#We will use the WEBSITE (you can run on the command line, which is best if you run on your data). See:
http://benhaller.com/messerlab/asymptoticMK.html



#INPUT FILES

/embo/data/aida/MK/input_files/

#Copy them to your home (path of your choice)

Two types of files:

*_no1
#The files with only polymorphic sites (the one to upload)

*_with1
#This files including the number of substitutions (d, dS). These two values need to be pasted on the web page.



#Go to the webpage and, using the sample data file, explore how changing d and d0 influences the inferences.

#Run the provided files in this order:
#AfricanAmerican
#EuropeanAmerican
#PongoAbe
#PongoPyg

#Note that you need to upload the file “_no1” and paste the counts of sites with frequency 1 in the webpage



#Is thre much difference between AfricanAmericans and EuropeanAmericans? Do you find this surprising?

#Are you surprised by the differences between the humans and Drosophila results?

#What do you think of the Pongo analyses?

#Any interesting biological questions one could ask with this approach?
