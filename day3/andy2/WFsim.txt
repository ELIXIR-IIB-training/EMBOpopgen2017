# ASSIGNMENT 1: Conduct runs of the above simulation, and 
# calculate the variance in allele frequencies across 20
# independent sample populations for each of generations 20
# through 200 in steps of 20.  Plot the results.
# Hint: the variance of allele freq at gen i is var(pcur[i,]


# ANSWER:

gen<-seq(1:200)
varvec<-seq(1,200)
for (i in 1:ngen){
  varvec[i]<-var(pcur[i,])
}
plot(gen,varvec,type="b",xlab="Generation",ylab="Variance among reps")

# You can see that the variance increases.  It is non-linear in
# the plot because of the fact that subpopulations are 
# going to fixation, when variance of course can no longer 
# increase.


# ASSIGNMENT 2: Plot the expected time to fixation (when allele 
# frequency is either 0 or 1) for 20 populations with population 
# sizes 50, 100, 150 and 200, starting from p = 0.5.

# The mean fixation times for the populations of size 
# 50,100,150, and 200 are:

mean(fixtime[1,])
mean(fixtime[2,])
mean(fixtime[3,])
mean(fixtime[4,])

# Note that the variance in fixation time is huge, so 20 replicates
# is not enough to give very consistent results.
