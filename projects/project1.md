## Positive selection in North-East Siberia

### AIM:
To find a signal(s) of positive selection on chromosome 11 in North-Eastern Siberians

### Data

Sequence data from 61 individuals belonging to three populations with a mean coverage of ~40X using the Complete Genomics platform. Chromosome 11 has been extracted and a vcf file is made available for:

11 East Asia
25 Europeans
25 NE Siberia

vcf location:/embo/Chiara/project1

### Steps for your analysis

- data quality check
- chromosome-wide scan for positive selection (think which measure(s)  is(are) appropriate)
- which genes are involved? can you identify specific variants?
