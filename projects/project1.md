## Positive selection in North-East Siberians

### Aim
To find a signal(s) of positive selection on chromosome 11 in North-Eastern Siberians

### Data

Sequence data from 61 individuals belonging to three populations with a mean coverage of ~40X using the Complete Genomics platform. Chromosome 11 has been extracted and a vcf file is made available for:

- 11 East Asia
- 25 Europeans
- 25 NE Siberia

data is on the INFN machine in

### Steps for your analysis

- data quality check
- chromosome-wide scan for positive selection (think which measure(s)  is(are) appropriate)
- which genes are involved? can you identify specific variants?  
- what could be the driver(s) of selection?
